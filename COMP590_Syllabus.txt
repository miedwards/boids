Course Description:
Introduction to the concepts of cooperative control and motion coordination of mobile robots. The course introduces the distributed algorithms used to coordinate robotic networks.
Student Learning Outcomes
By the successful completion of this course, you will be able to:
Use concepts from graph theory to analyze coordination behaviors from biology.
Analyze, design, implement, and test distributed algorithms used for robot coordination.
Use geometric models and optimization to analyze distributed algorithms for mobile robots.
Perform a literature review of relevant work related to robot coordination.
Give an oral presentation describing existing research in the field of robot coordination.
Learning Environment:
Each class session will be a blend of lecture and lab.  Since the class is three hours long, we will try to break it up in to section including, lecture to cover new material and laboratory programming assignments designed to exercise the material covered in lecture.
Grading:
The course grade will be determined by a weighted average of homeworks, exam, and project.

Homeworks – 50%
There will be approximately 5 homework assignments during the course of the semester.  Questions will be drawn from reading assignments and material discussed in the lecture.


Exams – 20%
Midterm - Date: March 14, 2106

Final Project – 30%
The culminating assignment for the class will be a project.  In this project you will have the choice of proposing your own research project related to this course or you may choose from a selection of relevant research papers to review.  You will prepare a short write-up of the project (4-6 pages) along with a short presentation (around 20 minutes).  More details to come….
